**As a datascientist or an MLEngineer building a model on my laptop,
**I want** to be able to register and publish a model on the model platform's registry.

Publishing the model will allow its tracking and storage. This will allow its deployment. 

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The model I trained and set to publish should correctly appear in MLflow with its metadata. The artefact should appear in the dedicated storage

Please also note:

1. If I forgot to put mandatory metadata, the publishing should be refused with a message reminding me about mandatory metadata
